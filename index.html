                <p>
                    A good website  is an important element of creating a successful business website.
                     It connects the gap between what a business owner envisions and what a website development team can make.
                     The website  details the design process, what is expected, and what the time frame is.
                      With this, both parties know what is expected of them. It describes deliverables, workflow, and follow-up support.
                      Pay particular attention to an attractive interface. It depends on the business how much freedom the web designers will have.
                       I made two official website clones of Apple and Amazon.

                <p>
                    Problem solving is the process of achieving a goal by overcoming obstacles, 
                    a frequent part of most activities. Problems in need of solutions range from 
                    simple personal tasks to complex issues in business and technical fields

                <p>
                    A team environment allows individuals to bring their diverse perspectives 
                    to problem solving, which in turn increases their success at arriving at 
                    solutions more efficiently and effectively.
                    Working in teams provides people more opportunities to release their 
                    creative ideas and increases their sense of belonging.
